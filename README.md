# EE120A
 
  EE120A was the first Electrical Engineering class I took at UC Riverside. In this class we dove more in hardware by coding in Verilog to a BASYS board. We continued with logic gates, muxes, latches, and state machines. This class was a very brief intro to lower-level language programming, like CS061, but more emphasis on hardware.
